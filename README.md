<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Emotion Detection Application by Falcons.ai

In this project I wanted to test the capability of generating a full screen video background using the rear facing camera of my mobile device through a web browser. Then take certain stills of that live feed and save them to the device. This was all done using standard libraries for Bootstrap, Jquery, Javascript and CSS. The implementation was not very difficult or cumbersome at all.

## Output

In the images below you can see still shots of the application runnning on your local machine. When deployed to Streamlit platform there are obstacles to accessing the users web cam through the browser that I and others have yet to overcome. But, It does work fine on your local machine.
